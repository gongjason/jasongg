# Jason Gong's Site

## Theme

This website uses a forked version of the [cactus](https://github.com/gongjason/hugo-theme-cactus/tree/a27a14348040b919818cbc862e3667c05f90b077) theme.

Most modifications are for style.

## Built with Hugo

Run the following to start the development server locally. Use the `-D` flag to also publish drafts.

```shell
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

## Deployment

The included [GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/hugo.yml) publishes the Hugo site. It's based on [Hugo's docs](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action).
